Hello! I am Rudolph Dees. I went to UCF and graduated with a Mathematics Degree. I play a lot of video games and watch a lot of hockey. I am a huge Tampa Bay Lightning fan
and have a Basset Hound with my Fiance.

I am actively working on a C# WPF project in .NET CORE called "NHL_Stats_App" and am having a blast. I am completely self taught besides the few programming classes I took
in college 5 years ago and am enjoying the process of learning new things and discovering what I am capable of. I have outlined my goals and progress in the NHL_Stats_App README
so I strongly encourage you to go take a look at that project. 

I am currently exploring a new position in Data Analysis or Programming. If any potential employers would like to reach out and discuss my skills and background feel free to email me 
at rudydees96@gmail.com so we can set up a phone call.
